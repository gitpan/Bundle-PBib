ToDo for LitUI, Biblio, ReferenceConverter et al.
=================================================

This is my personal list of what I want to add as soon as I have some time.



- most of all: write lots of documentation ......


- major re-design: use some XSL based formatting of references ...

- rename file "CrossRef" to e.g. "XRef" to avoid confusion with bibtex's field, which does not always act the same way as PBib would do.


- interal charset should always be utf8 --> check document handling (quote / unquote methods, esp. look at RTF) and biblio database handling (via bp).

- release file after save as (04-03-17: fixed??)
- ACM / default style: support "inline" fields!

David,

FYI, the last release of the OpenOffice::OODoc Perl API (to be released
in the next few hours) includes accessors allowing easy read/update
queries against any biblio property.

Example:

@list = $doc->getBibliographyEntries("GEN99");

returns the full list of entries where the identifier matches "GEN99"

$doc->bibiographyEntryContent
             (
             "GEN99",
             title     => "My Title",
             author    => "A Name",
             isbn      => "xxxzzz"
             );

updates (or creates) some properties of the [GEN99] entry

%properties = $doc->bibliographyEntryContent("GEN99");

returns a hash table (i.e. key/value pairs) containing all the
properties of [GEN99]

I hope that will help to develop quick scripts that directly process
bibliography entries in the OOo files...
<<<

- integrate support for Bibilio::CiteParser to support maintainance of bibliography databases


Config:
- parse cmd line args with dot-syntax, e.g. -item.style=IEEE
- maybe use AppConfig::Std

LitUI:

- resize main search windows: not only resize the text box at the bottom!!!

- store paper: add paper to internal biblio DB (or update).


- LitUIRef Dialog: use different conv. styles in menu items!


- Paper menu: export found refs to bibtex etc.
-- works?


- pop-menu for query-history -- häufigsten und letzten einträge nach vorn

- verwaltung von comments, todos (button, der ein fenster öffnet, wie bei search)

- check for newly added references:
  for "new" references try to analyze them (extract author, title fragment etc.)
  and query for matching refs.
  These should be presented in a separate window, and
  it should be possible to automatically replace 'em in word ...
- show rated + unused refs: get recommendation from biblio + sort unused according to it
  = check used papers and their recommendation (if recommended papers are missing)
  => maybe this should be integrated in the ToDo handling(?)
- check-buttons: "display used only", "display known only", "new", "unknown & not new"
- refactor: sub-modules for Ref-Lists
- support multiple top-level windows (for different papers) ... needed???
- fork thread to update widgets ... geht das?

LitUIRefDialog:
- LitUIRefDialog: insert ref: neuen text selektieren
- LitUIRefDialog: insert hyperlink for Source, doi, BibSource, File, ...

LitUISearchDialog:
- im menü: alle references von dem suchergebnis ins clipboard als [[S1], [S2], ...]

LitRefs:

- bug: quote single (and double?) quotes in SQL select (')
- LitRefs should use PBib::Document.pm
- eigentlich sollte LitUI LitRefs gar nicht mehr benutzen ...

PBib/Doc:
- MSWord: paragraphs should return also other "stories" (text flows) beside 
  the main one, esp. footnote/endnotes, or comments, or whichever other stories exist ...


PBib:

*****  option to load files that should be scanned for references, but that are not processed. This can be used to be able to have a document stored in multiple files and convert a single file (esp. the one with the bibliography!), without processing the others (well, only scanning).  *****

*** option to use PDF or HTML field to generate a hyperlink to the PDF in the bibliography.

***  option includeURL: "first" = include only one URL, if multiple are given (the first). (or maybe also "last")  ***


- IEEETR style for proceedings (12) is broken. (need optional author?)

- support field "CiteAlias[es]".

- make pbib file read-only after processing
  (to avoid that it is acidently edited ...)

- option to produce more verbose warning messages, e.g. if a "?" is found in pages or URL, or if an author has no first name, or ... well ...

- format Names: use tie connect between Firstnames and Lastname if Firstnames is a single "A." only, e.g. "P.~Tandler"
- format Names: the "last, first" styles is broken if there is no first name ...

- options for formatting fields that have multiple references.
  e.g. sort by year or sort by key/year, group refs by 
  key (author)
  "(Streitz 1997, 2000, 2001; Tandler 1999, 2002)"

- support for translating titles etc. "Title:EN=The translated title in English", maybe also for some other fields. The current language setting can be used to select the field. Some styles can offer to add a translated title (etc.) for publications in a foreign language.
- option to force CrossRef overwrite fields (e.g. Proceedings entry has higher precedence than InProceedings)

- options for normalizing SuperTitle fields etc. (always use same conference name, same abbrev. etc.)

- I should use Text::BibTeX::Name to help name processing!!
- RC's scanner: option to expand embedded references

- "validate bibDB" function: check all entries in the $refs hash, if they are complete (no missing fields etc.), without processing a file.

- LabelStyle::Name: option "forcekey" should take the key as name, but add the year anyway! This should
  be the way this is handeled by bibtex?

- LabelSytle: provide additional keys as options (to pbib)
  (which are always forced to be used)
- adapt the BibItem's sortkeyFor method to be used by the LabelStyle!
- check: in unique labels are generated: the order should be same as in bibliography!
- general handling of special entry types like "Name", "Title", "Enum", "Date",
  "Text", "Number", ...
  e.g. Pages : Enum (format range), Authors : Name (e.g. format to Lastname,
  Firstnames, or use Lastname for sorting etc.),
  Title, SuperTitle : Title (sortkey: strip leading "The"/"A"/...)

- check for common errors in bibliographies
 - e.g. "et. al" should be "et al."
 - correct usage of fields etc.
- fix handling of "et al." as an author name (produce right label, etc.)

- new Ref'Style: Footnote, ~Endnote
- new LabelStyles: ~FullName, ~Abbrev, ~Number
- LabelStyle: option which parentheses and separator to use, e.g.
  "(;)" or "[,]" or "{;}"

- LabelStyle / RefStyle: specify sort order for multi-ref fields, e.g. sort by order in
  bibliography, by year, by label (alphabetically), ...
  [[b], [a], [c]] --> ["a", "b", "c"] ("x" stands for the label of [x])

- option "noauthor" - should be different from "inline": really don't print author name
- option "inline-one" and "inline-mult" to ensure that one / several names are generated.
  This can be quite helpfull if the name is used as the subject withing the sentence.
  In the case of one required author, only the first author should be output (with a warning).
  In the case of several authors, an error should be given if the referenced paper has only one.
  --> or should this be handled with "noauthor"??
- option "inline": add correct handling of multiple references given in a single field,
  e.g. [[BEACH-SyncCollaboration], [BEACH-AppModel+FW]]. This should be formated as
  "Tandler (2001; 2002)", while
  [[BEACH-SyncCollaboration], [BEACH-ConnecTables]] should yield
  "Tandler (2001; Tandler et al. 2001)"
- option "noparens", when the ref is within parentheses "(...[:noparens|...]...)" to suppress the output of 
  parentheses. If the current style uses brackets "[...]", they may be generated.
- option "all" for bibliographies: include all references, not only thoses cited in the document.
  Especially helpfull for constrained bibliographys (with SQL select pattern).

- Ref'Converter: support for unknown, (unused,), and new references
- Ref'Converter: finalize-check (option "-final"):
  look for remaining "??", "#", ">>" and
  unrsolved references, highlighted text, comments etc. in the document ...
  what about: [< some todo item?? >], [:global options ... ] |] :]
  BUT: remove comments & todos when option "-final" is given!!!!!
  => write ToDo items and new references to $outfile.todo
- also support replacement of refs within todo+comment fields and
  support todo + comment references (i.e. a [<...>] embedded within a
  normal ref field.
- pbib: options to select styles (dynamically check for available modules)
- pbib: get default options from ENV or .cnf file

- use bp to handle correct quoting of chars, esp. unbalanced "{"
  or quotes in biblio fields ....

- BibItem & Ref: support backward references from bibliography to all places
  where an item was cited (see [[ContextToolkit-ArchSupport]])
- BibItem option: prepend label to each item, e.g. "[Tan01] P. Tandler ...."
- BibItem: support for line-break before each trailer field (URL, Note)
- BibItem: more options to include other fields in trailer (Keywords, ...)
  (using format_miscEntry())
- BibItem: option to define bookmark around author (or arbitrary field?)
  This would be better for the RefStyle::Field that the user can generate
  e.g. the Author as the field's text.
- BibItem: use keyword abbev. also within SupterTitle, Journal, etc.
  to replace "Proceedings" => "Proc.", "Symposium" => "Sypm." etc.
  optionally remove "on", "the", ...
  (=> could be used in new style/option for short papers etc.)
- BibItem + Label: If no explicit label is generated in the bibliography (and no
  number), provide an option to include the "uniqueness-postfix" generated by
  the label in the year-field, e.g. "Tandler, P. (2000b). BEACH ..."

- Bibitem: new field CiteState: "to appear", "submitted" -- e.g. for inproceedings
  or better: check year and month, if that's in future use "to appear in"
  -- do I need an additional field ("PubDate" = date of conference or "submitted")

- Bibliography: allow different sort styles, e.g. "by label" (default if label
  is included in items), "as referenced", "by (last)name" ...
  How can the sorting by coupled with the BibItem style?
- Bibliography: sorting error "Jr. Dan Olsen" is sorted as "Dan", not "Olsen"

- PBib: use bp Biblio::BP or (s.th. like PBib::Utils?) for debugging messages

- check tib reference style [:...:] -- should pbib support arbitrary
  reference source styles as well??

Biblio:
- Biblio::BP: extend goterror, gotwarn, debugs to support log file!
- Biblio-shortcuts: warn about undefined shortcuts
- multiple cite-keys would be nice, they could be automatically computed
  (e.g. from a pattern: "Tool-Conference" or "Author-Year-AbbrevTitle" etc.)


=======================================

done:
- update: always update both refs and paper! (?)
- Move some formatting information from ReferenceFormators to Documents:
  only document should know their true syntax,
  ref'Formators should use abstract interface + rely on Doc's quote()
  => Ref'Form'RTF -> Ref'Form'Field uses Doc's field() etc. methods
- allow "inline" references like [Author1, Author2 "Title" ....] that will be
  included in bibliographies!
- search author dialog
- search keyword dialog (look in keyword, title, comment, note, ....)
- read paper ==> update refs list also! (used/unused might have changed)
- BibItem bug: output "et al." instead of "et al.." if the Author field ends
  with a dot.
- BibItem bug: don't output "edition" if the Edition field is not an (ordinal) number
- button: "copy selected ref to clipboard", "find + jump to selected ref in word"
- search dialog: search case-independent
- "open" doc button: open selected document (in word or notepad or associated app.)
- pbib-import: import bib's into std-bib
- doppel-klick in ref liste öffnet refs fenster
- jump-to-key: auch für liste mit focus
- option "inline" print "Tandler et al. (2000)" (et al. could be in italics!)
- PBib: fix creation of bookmarks in IEEE style
- LitUIRefDialog: use PBib to generate sensible output of reference!
- use bp ...
- support for xrefs.: define conferences and journals (see bibtex)
- multiple CrossRef entries for a ref, separated by comma. now you can include conference and author address etc.
- pop-menu for query-history -- doppelte raus!
- LitUI: Open document should use previous file's dir as default dir

15.3.03
- two options for etal count: for label and for bibitem (might be larger or 0 (zero), if always all authors should be included).

21.5.03
- expand crossref now also adapts the CiteType (journal -> article, etc.)

*** new CiteType for workshop position papers, that have no publisher, but published online.
--> simple solution: use CiteType "talk". "talk" is now modified to be like inproceedings, but with optional publisher.

23.5.03
*** support for parsing names: use "/" as separator
	/Jones/von/John/Jr./,/Krol/Ed/,/Beethoven/von/Ludwig/
	i.e.
		2 "/" -> "/Company/"
		3 "/" -> "/Lastname/Firstnames/"
		4 "/" -> hm ... "/Lastname/von/Firstnames/"
		5 "/" -> "/Lastname/von/Firstnames/Jr/"
	is it ok to separate Firstnames by spaces? or can a single name contain a 
	space? in this case it might be quoted "\ " ...
	by using a starting and trailing "/" we can distinguish this format from ord. names.


11.01.04
- ein "details of selected paper" view (->toni)
- LitUIRefDialog: CrossRef in LitUIRefDialog: the CrossRef item is not included. (geht jetzt glaub ich)
- LitUIRefDialog:menu öffnet nicht über alt+taste (works)

12.02.04 (geht schon länger)
*** edit window for LitUI: paste entry as bibtex or as "k=v\n" that can be modified and will be parsed afterwards ***
--> 04-02-12: bibtex is not supported for import and export.


- Config module ausprobieren & einbinden -- geht jetzt???
---> reload config button? oder wird die config eh jedes mal neu eingelesen?
--> 04-02-12: im "processPaperFile" wird jedes mal ein neues Config gemacht.

- jump-to-key: handling wie bei windows (if at key, jump to next occurance)
--> nö.
- jump-to-key doesn't work anymore .....!!!
--> geht wieder.

- ctrl-a, ctrl-f: select whole text in input field, not only place cursor!!!
--> 04-02-12: done

- option to send all debug to .log file
--> done

- count time needed for processing
--> 04-02-12: done
