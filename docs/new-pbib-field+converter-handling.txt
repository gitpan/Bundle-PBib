Some ideas on how to re-implement the formatting part

> abstract type "entry"

a "entry" can be:
- an entry in the DB (the ref's dictionary)
- a computed entry, e.g.
	AuthorEditor = "Author" XOR "Editor"
- a computed entry with formatting, e.g.
	BookTitleIt = Italic(SuperTitle)
- a group of other entries, e.g.
	VolNumPages = "Volume" ??
		"Volume" . '(' . "Number" . '):' . Range("Pages")

--> issue: when should the field's type-based formatting apply? always at first usage?

> inheritance for CiteTypes

- define supported + optional fields for the CiteType
  -> warning if missing
  -> warning if a given field is unused
- define possible fields (e.g bibliographic stuff" for all types 
  in base class "Reference" (or whatever)


> Formatting based on entry "types", e.g. Name, URL, List, ...
