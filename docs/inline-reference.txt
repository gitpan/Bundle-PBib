Some ideas how to parse inline references, i.e. references that don't come 
from the database, but are embedded in the document, e.g.
"... as defined in [[Peter Tandler "Inline References in PBib", In some fancy 
Conference, pp. 300-302, 2002]]."

This would be nice, especially if the inline references would be automatically 
added to the main bibliographic database and replaced in the document ...

But this is not yet implemented.

Reference ::= Authors \" Title \" Fields
Authors ::= String \s* ( [.,;] )? \s*
Title ::= String
Fields ::= \s* Field \s* ( "," Fields )?

Field ::= ... well .... some heuristic! :-)

SuperTitle ::= "In:?\s*\"" SuperTitle \" -- hint for CiteType=6
Year ::= "\d\d(\d\d)?"

The BNF uses a perl regexp style. special chars are quote with backslash. 
Tereminal text is always placed within quotes.


I found perl modules that might help, Biblio-DocParser / Biblio-CiteParser, 
but I didn't look at them yet.
