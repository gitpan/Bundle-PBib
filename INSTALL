Requirements
============

Requirements to install and run PBib:

- You need some perl to run PBib. I use the ActivePerl 5.8
  (you can get it from http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl).
  I recommend that the perl interpreter is in your PATH.
  If you use another perl distribution, you might need to install
  some other packages, not mentioned in the dependencies.

- To run the scripts, you should associate the .pl extension with 
  perl on Windows, on Unix you perl should be in /usr/bin/perl.

- You need a couple of Perl modules. These are listed in Build.PL.
  In this distribution, Config::General and bp are included.

- If you want to run PBibTk (the GUI for PBib), you need the 
  perl Tk package. This comes with ActivePerl.

- If you want to install the PBib perl modules (not necessary if 
  you just want to run PBib or PBibTk), you need Module::Build.
  You can get it e.g. from 
  http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Module/Module-Build-0.2604.tar.gz
  Please be aware that when installing the perl modules,
  Config::General is silently overwritten.


Installing PBib modules
=======================

The easiest way to do this is like so:

perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build install

You can also optionally run 'perl Build test', which will run a few checks on the modules.
